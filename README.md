# Dog_Breed_Classifier

## Introduction 
Dog Breed Classifier project is a part of Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree. In this project, I aim to build neural network
pipelines to process real-world, user-supplied images. Concretely I built Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) from scratch 
and applied transfer learning respectively to identify an estimate of the canine's breed in a given image. If supplied an image
of a human, the algorithm should identify the resembling dog breed.
